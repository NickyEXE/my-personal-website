        <h1>Nicky Dover's Personal Website</h1>
        <p>This is a work in progress as I prepare for the job search!</p>
        <p>To be honest, I'm mostly maintaining this website to play around on the AWS backend right now.</p>
        <p>Probably going to rebuild this in React because that's what everyone wants today.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, please amuse yourself with one of my projects:</p>
